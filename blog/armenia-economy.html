<h1>Armenia, Complexity, and the Limits of Economic Modelling</h1>
<p class="meta">2026.02.12 · Economics · Probability</p>

<p>
Armenia’s recent economic trajectory illustrates the growing limits of
conventional macroeconomic modelling. Rapid geopolitical shocks,
migration flows, sanctions spillovers, and abrupt trade reconfigurations
created growth dynamics that traditional frameworks struggled to forecast.
</p>

<h2>Complexity Versus Model Parsimony</h2>

<p>
Econometric models simplify reality to produce estimable relationships.
However, Armenia’s expansion demonstrates the fragility of historical
assumptions when structural breaks reshape trade networks and labour
markets simultaneously. Parameter stability weakens and historical
relationships lose predictive power.
</p>

<p>
Many macroeconomic models assume stationarity — that past statistical
relationships remain informative about the future. Armenia’s experience
resembles a structural break rather than a cyclical deviation. In
probabilistic terms, the underlying data generating process shifted,
rendering conventional inference unstable.
</p>

<h2>The Probability Lens</h2>

<p>
Traditional statistical practice focuses on parameter uncertainty.
Yet Armenia highlights model uncertainty itself. When geopolitical
dynamics reshape incentives and economic structures, the problem is
not merely noisy data but an inadequate modelling framework.
</p>

<p>
Bayesian updating allows analysts to revise beliefs as new evidence
arrives, but even Bayesian methods rely on priors that may fail in
unprecedented environments. Hybrid approaches incorporating network
analysis and adaptive modelling are increasingly necessary.
</p>

<h2>Narratives and Behavioural Dynamics</h2>

<p>
Investor psychology, migration decisions, and policy improvisation
played outsized roles in Armenia’s growth. Behavioural responses and
expectations amplified economic changes faster than traditional
forecasting models could capture, highlighting the importance of
narrative economics in modern macro analysis.
</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>
Recent financial commentary notes that economic models struggle to
capture fast-moving and unpredictable structural shifts. Armenia’s
experience reinforces that models are approximations rather than
deterministic predictors. Statistical inference must therefore remain
probabilistic and adaptive.
